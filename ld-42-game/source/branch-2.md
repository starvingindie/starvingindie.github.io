## SCENE TWO ALTERNATE
You decide that it's probably better to get on the demons good side. Unfortunately, sweet talking them into letting you go on a date doesn't work. They're still pissed about when you tried to get rid of them the last time they haunted your apartment.

- [You offer them a gift](/chapter-two-three)


## CHAPTER TWO-THREE
A brilliant idea hits you! What do Demons love more than anything else? Souls! If you can just find your cat, Mochi, you can offer her soul up to the Demons and then they'll forgive you. Right?! Cats have nine souls anyways... or is it lives? Same difference.

- [You go in search for Mochi](/chapter-two-four)


## CHAPTER TWO-FOUR
You go looking for your cat. To your horror, you catch a glimpse of Mochi just as she's being eaten by your stinky and decaying Zombie Couch. Of course! It's going to take forever to get Mochi out of that damn Zombie Couch.

- ["This is not how I thought tonight would go..."](/scene-seventeen)

---

## SCENE SEVENTEEN
Ok! Time to defeat the Zombie Couch. As you get closer you start to lose motivation. You're becoming lazier and lazier. OH NO!! The Zombie Couch has cast some weird spell on you! Suddenly you receive a buzzing message.

- [Check your phone](/scene-eighteen)
- [Take a quick nap](/death-thirteen)

## DEATH THIRTEEN
A little power nap won't hurt right? WRONG! That is the last nap you ever take. You do not wake up.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-seventeen)

## SCENE EIGHTEEN
It's from your date! They're not going to want to be involved with a Couch Potato. Through sheer desire, you snap out of your trance. As you do, the Couch opens up and wraps it's slimy tongue around you. It's strength is crazy! It's pulling you into the cushions.

- [Grab a sharp object](/scene-nineteen)
- [Pry yourself open](/death-fourteen)

## DEATH FOURTEEN
I wasn't kidding when I said it's strength is crazy! As you try to pry yourself free, it tightens its grip on you. You suffucate to death.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-seventeen)

## SCENE NINETEEN
As you're about to be swallowed whole, you yank out a spring from inside the Zombie Couch's mouth and use it to slice off it's tongue! The Zombie Couch releases its grip on you and spits out Mochi! Success! Mochi pops out and runs away as your couch dies.

- [>](/prize-four)

## PRIZE FOUR
You've found a $5 bill and a lazer pointer in the Couch Cushions. YAY!!

- [>](/scene-twenty)

---

## SCENE TWENTY
Now that the Couch is dead, time to catch Mochi so you can trade her soul for romance. However she's does not seem ok with this deal. She's morphing into a ravenous monster. You're not going to trade her soul without a fight.

- [Quick! Get the catnip!](/scene-twenty-one)
- [Try to calm Mochi with pets](/death-fifteen)

## DEATH FIFTEEN
As soon as you try to pet her, she hisses... she came here to fight! She scratches up your face bad. There's no way you can go on a date looking like this!

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty)

## SCENE TWENTY-ONE
Mochi is growing bigger and bigger! If you can just get to the catnip in the kitchen, you should be able to knock her out. But Mochi is blocking the way... and she's looking like she wants to scratch your eyeballs out.

- [ITEM:LAZER POINTER](/scene-twenty-two)
- [Fight Mochi](/death-sixteen)
- [Push past Mochi](/death-seventeen)

## DEATH SIXTEEN
You attempt to fight Mochi, but she hurls fur balls at you and proceeds to scratch up your entire face. There's no way you can go on a date looking like this!

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty)


## DEATH SEVENTEEN
Mochi isn't having it! She grows so large and starts to hurl fur balls at you, while scratching up your entire face. There's no way you can go on a date looking like this!

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty)


## SCENE TWENTY-TWO
GREAT THINKING! You use the lazer pointer to distract Mochi. She frantically chases after the shiny red dot as you snatch up the catnip. Once you have it, you throw the catnip all over the floor. Mochi loses interest in the dot and proceeds to roll around in the nip.

- [>](/prize-five)

## PRIZE FIVE
Mochi shrunk back down! You now have a cat soul to trade!

- [>](/scene-twenty-three)

---

## SCENE TWENTY-THREE
With Mochi in hand, you try to offer the demons her soul as a "sorry gift", but Demons are mad that you killed the Zombie Couch. That was one their own, after all.

- [Bargain with the Demons](/scene-twenty-four)
- [Tell them to suck it up](/death-seventeen)

## DEATH SEVENTEEN
This does not go over well with the Demons. They, in return, keep you from leaving the apartment to go on your date, all the while tell YOU to suck it up.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty-three)

## SCENE TWENTY-FOUR
You try to bargain with them, but they don't know what else you could possibly provide them that they'd want. A cat's soul is not enough. You gotta sweeten the pot.

- [Offer them your own soul](/death-eighteen)
- [ITEM: Lazer Pointer](/death-nineteen)
- [ITEM: $5](/scene-twenty-five)

## DEATH EIGHTEEN
Unwise! You offer up your own soul and the demons take it immediately. Within seconds you drop to the floor with a lifeless gaze. I don't think you'll be making your date tonight.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty-three)

## DEATH NINETEEN
You hand over the lazer pointer you pulled from the Zombie Couch. The Demons give you a look like, "What are we supposed to do with this?" They're offeneded and determined not let you go on your date.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty-three)

## SCENE TWENTY-FIVE
GREAT THINKING! 

You offer the Demons the $5 bill you found in the couch. They're quick to snatch it from your hands and take Mochi's soul. The Demons forgive you and tell you they won't bother you anymore, but they can't say the same for the other haunted things in your house.
