## CHAPTER ONE: NOT AGAIN
You need to make it to your date on time, but you can't leave your apartment because it's being curse by demons that are occupying more and more space.

---

## SCENE FOURTEEN
You're almost there!!

With the Demons taken care of, you rush for the door hoping to make it to your date on time. As you go to leave your apartment, the front door turns into a large mouth that looks like there isn't enough food in this world to satisfy its hunger!

- [Try feeding it random objects](/death-ten)
- [Look for an opening to get passed it](/scene-fifteen)

## DEATH TEN
You try to feed the door random objects in the house, but it only gets more and more hungry until finally it devours you alive! It is true, nothing in this universe can satisfy its hunger!

## SCENE FIFTEEN
You study the Door Monster carefully as you dodge its chomps. It's just a door, if you can reach the door knob, you should just be able to walk right out- but as soon as you do, it immediately locks itself! "Hahaha how will you get passed a locked door?!"

- [Beat it with a drain pipe](/death-eleven)
- [Stab the door with your sword](/death-twelve)
- [ITEM: SOURCE KEY](/scene-sixteen)

## DEATH ELEVEN
You try to use your drain pipe to break off the dead bolt, but it ends up breaking the drain pipe instead. The door laughs as it chomps you up in one bite!

## DEATH TWELVE
You try to stab the door with your sword, but it just devours you in one bite.

## SCENE SIXTEEN
GREAT THINKING! It suddenly occurs to you, why not just unlock the door? You stick the Source Key into the Door Monster's Lock and turn the key. The monster is defeated and your whole apartment turns back to normal.

You exit your apartment, lock the door behind you and head off to meet your date.

CONGRATULATIONS YOU'VE ACHIEVED ONE OF FOUR ENDINGS!
