## CHAPTER TWO: WHERE DID I PUT THAT KEY?
You need to get rid of the demons, but the source key to get rid of them is lost somewhere in your house. You've misplaced it.

---

## SCENE ELEVEN
You need to defeat the demons with the source key, but they've grown stronger since the last time you've battled them.

Now that you have the Source Key, it's time to defeat these damn demons! As you approach them with the Source Key, they keep their distance, but they laugh. They've grown stronger since the last time you've had to deal with them. Much much stronger.

- [ITEM: DRAIN PIPE](/death-seven)
- [Find a deadly weapon](/scene-twelve)

## DEATH SEVEN
You try to fight them with your drain pipe, but I wasn't kidding when I said they've grown much stronger. They rip you up into little tiny pieces.

## SCENE TWELVE
That's right! You remember there's a sword under your bed. If you can attach the Source Key with the sword, not only can you keep the demons at bay, but you can hack them up too! Only problem, is a hoard of Demons stands between you and your bedroom.

- [Try to climb over the demons](/death-eight)
- [Try to reason with the demons](/death-nine)
- [ITEM: SOURCE KEY](/scene-thirteen)

## DEATH EIGHT
You try to climb over the demons, but your attempt turns into a violent version of crowd surfing. The demons have a frenzy gnawing you to pieces.

## DEATH NINE
You try to reason with demons, but they just laugh at you and then proceed to rip you to shreds. Demons are not to be reasoned with!

## SCENE THIRTEEN
GREAT THINKING! The Demons aren't harmed by the Source Key, but they're still keeping their distance. You use the source key to carve a path through the demons to your bedroom. As soon as you find your sword, you waist no time slashing the demons into bits.

## PRIZE THREE

You've earned a sword!!
