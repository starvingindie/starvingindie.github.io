## SCENE ONE
<img src="images/apartmentDemonsPortrait.png">Your dream date is waiting! You're late! And of course, the demons in your apartment are keeping you from leaving the apartment. Not again! They're occupying more and more space. It's been years, since you've been on a date... you'll be damned if you miss it.

- [Get rid of the Demons](/scene-two)
- [Appeal to the Demons](/scene-two-alternate#mochi)



<span class="clear"></span>


## SCENE TWO
<img src="images/kitchen_ghoul.png">
Yeah, these demons and ghouls need to go. The last time they invaded your house you used a magical Source Key to get them to leave. You quickly scan your room, but it's a mess. It's cluttered with a bunch of figurines and video games. You can't remember where you left that Source Key!

- [Look for the source key](/scene-three)
- [Craft a brand new Source Key](/scene-three-alternate)

<span class="clear"></span>


## SCENE THREE
You go in search for the Source Key. Ugh! This apartment is a mess. It's becoming difficult to even move around with all the clutter. The demons know you're searching for the Source Key. 

<img src="images/landscape_bathroom2.png" class="landscape">

Suddenly, your teleported into the bathroom. The door locks behind you. Just great!

- [Break off the door knob!](/scene-four)
- [Search for a way out](/scene-four-alternate)



<span class="clear"></span>


## SCENE FOUR
<img src="images/mirrorPortrait.png">

As you reach for the door, you hear a demonic voice from behind you. It sounds just like you. You turn to see an enraged bathroom mirror trying to hypnotize you into its black infinite abyss... You try to resist, but the mirror's hypnotizing voice is so soothing....

<img src="images/mirrorGhoul.png">

- [Smash the bathroom mirror](/scene-five)


<span class="clear"></span>


## SCENE FIVE
<img src="images/shardsIcon.png">

You wrap a towel around your hand and punch the bathroom mirror as hard as you can! SMASH! Shards of the mirror fall to the ground... but suddenly they start to float upwards. Crap. The Evil Mirror Shards look like they're going to attack with lightning speed!

- [Try to dodge the shards](/death-one)
- [Use the mirror against itself](/scene-six)

<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH ONE
<img src="images/deathIcon1.png">
You try to dodge all the shards, but it's useless. They all fly at you too fast and pin you to the wall and skewer you.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-five)


<span class="clear"></span>


## SCENE SIX
<img src="images/voidPanel1.png">
You capture one of the shards out of the air and reflect it back at the mirror. The mirror becomes so confused that it begins to implode... BUT, in it's existential break down, it's trying to suck you into it's black reflective void.

- [Hold on to something tight!](/death-two)
- [Reach for the door knob!](/death-three)
- [Flood the bathroom!](/scene-seven)

<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH TWO
<img src="images/deathIcon2.png">
You hold on to the toilet in the hopes of not getting sucked in, but the void is too strong. It sucks you and the toilet into it.

This is absolutely the worst way to die... with a toilet.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-five)

<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH THREE
<img src="images/deathIcon3.png">
You try to hold on to the door handle, but the door is obviously a demon and chomps you in half. Your other half gets sucked into the void.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-five)

<span class="clear"></span>


## SCENE SEVEN
<img src="images/toiletIcon.png">
As you're being sucked into the void, you lift the toilet seat up, turn on all the faucets and the shower. For a brief moment you're sucked into the void with all the water, but then the mirror coughs you out as it drowns on all the water it's inhaling.

## PRIZE ONE

You can now use this item... With the Evil Mirror defeated, you escape the bathroom.

Now that you've escaped the bathroom, it's time to search for the Source Key. 

<img src="images/landscape_livingroom2.png" class="landscape">

As you search the living room, your junk rapidly begins to close in on you. Your running out of space to move and the strong walls are closing. Panic sets in as you figure out what to do...

- [Try to push the walls apart](/death-four)

<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH FOUR
<img src="images/deathIcon1.png">
You try to keep the walls from closing in by prying them open, but they're way to strong. You're slowly squished until you pop like a grape.

<img src="images/haunted_window.png">
You gather up the clutter around your living room and look for a place to chuck it... The window! But as you go to throw your junk out, the window snaps shut and locks itself. The window has always been so damn stubborn! This is it, you're going to drown in your own junk!

- [Quick! Look for the Source Key!](/death-five)
- [Try to unlock the window](/death-six)


<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH FIVE
<img src="images/deathIcon2.png">
You frantically look for the Source Key in a race against the clock, but there's too much stuff to sift through and it looks like all your junk is now multiplying. You're squished to death under the weight of your own apartment objects.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-eight)

<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH SIX
<img src="images/deathIcon3.png">
You try to unlock the window, but the window is as stubborn as you remember. The window just laughs at you as you're drowned to death under the weight of your own clutter.

Now that you have the Source Key, it's time to defeat these damn demons! As you approach them with the Source Key, they keep their distance, but they laugh. They've grown stronger since the last time you've had to deal with them. Much much stronger.

- [Find a deadly weapon](/scene-twelve)

<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH SEVEN
<img src="images/deathIcon1.png">

That's right! You remember there's a sword under your bed. If you can attach the Source Key with the sword, not only can you keep the demons at bay, but you can hack them up too! Only problem, is a hoard of Demons stands between you and your bedroom.

You're almost there!!

With the Demons taken care of, you rush for the door hoping to make it to your date on time. As you go to leave your apartment, the front door turns into a large mouth that looks like there isn't enough food in this world to satisfy its hunger!

You study the Door Monster carefully as you dodge its chomps. It's just a door, if you can reach the door knob, you should just be able to walk right out- but as soon as you do, it immediately locks itself! "Hahaha how will you get passed a locked door?!"

You exit your apartment, lock the door behind you and head off to meet your date.

CONGRATULATIONS YOU'VE ACHIEVED ONE OF FOUR ENDINGS!

<span class="clear"></span>


## SCENE TWO ALTERNATE

You decide that it's probably better to get on the demons good side. Unfortunately, sweet talking them into letting you go on a date doesn't work. They're still pissed about when you tried to get rid of them the last time they haunted your apartment.

- [You offer them a gift](/chapter-two-three)


<span class="clear"></span>

## CHAPTER TWO-THREE

<img src="images/mochiIcon.png">
A brilliant idea hits you! What do Demons love more than anything else? Souls! If you can just find your cat, Mochi, you can offer her soul up to the Demons and then they'll forgive you. Right?! Cats have nine souls anyways... or is it lives? Same difference.

- [You go in search for Mochi](/chapter-two-four)


<span class="clear"></span>

## CHAPTER TWO-FOUR
<img src="images/Evil_couch.png" class="landscape">
You go looking for your cat. To your horror, you catch a glimpse of Mochi just as she's being eaten by your stinky and decaying Zombie Couch. Of course! It's going to take forever to get Mochi out of that damn Zombie Couch.

Ok! Time to defeat the Zombie Couch. As you get closer you start to lose motivation. You're becoming lazier and lazier. OH NO!! The Zombie Couch has cast some weird spell on you! Suddenly you receive a buzzing message.

## SCENE EIGHTEEN

It's from your date! They're not going to want to be involved with a Couch Potato. Through sheer desire, you snap out of your trance. As you do, the Couch opens up and wraps it's slimy tongue around you. It's strength is crazy! It's pulling you into the cushions.

- [Grab a sharp object](/scene-nineteen)
- [Pry yourself open](/death-fourteen)

<span class="clear"></span>

## DEATH FOURTEEN

I wasn't kidding when I said it's strength is crazy! As you try to pry yourself free, it tightens its grip on you. You suffucate to death.

## SCENE NINETEEN

<img src="images/spring_icon2.png">
As you're about to be swallowed whole, you yank out a spring from inside the Zombie Couch's mouth and use it to slice off it's tongue! The Zombie Couch releases its grip on you and spits out Mochi! Success! Mochi pops out and runs away as your couch dies.

This apartment is so cluttered, who knows where the key could be. Maybe it's better to just craft the Source Key instead of go looking for it. As you head to the kitchen to grab the ingredients, it goes up in a blaze of fire. An angry Kitchen Devil (a coffee maker) appears.
