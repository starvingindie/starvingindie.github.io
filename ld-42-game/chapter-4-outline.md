## CHAPTER FOUR: THE MIRROR ADDS 10 POUNDS
You need to break out of the bathroom, but the bathroom mirror has become enraged and wants to suck you into an infinite abyss.

---

You need to fight the bathroom mirror, but it breaks into hundreds of small shards that start to attack you...

	You try to dodge all the shards, but it's useless. They all fly at you too fast and pin you to the wall and skewer you.

You capture one of the shards out of the air and reflect it back at the mirror. The mirror becomes so confused that it implodes, but it's trying to suck you into it's void.

	You hold on to the toilet in the hopes of not getting sucked in, but the void is too strong. It sucks you and the toilet into it.

	You try to hold on to the door handle, but the door is obviously a demon and chomps you in half. Your other half gets sucked into the void.

You turn on all the water in the bathroom which gets sucked into the mirror's void, killing the mirror by drowning it. You earn a drain pipe!
