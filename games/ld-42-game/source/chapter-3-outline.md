## CHAPTER THREE: UGH! THE TOILET'S CLOGGED AGAIN...
You need to find the source key, but the demons trap you in the bathroom, so you can't go look for it.

---
## SCENE EIGHT
Now that you've escaped the bathroom, it's time to search for the Source Key. As you search the living room, your junk rapidly begins to close in on you. Your running out of space to move and the strong walls are closing. Panic sets in as you figure out what to do...

- [Try to push the walls apart](/death-four)
- [Quickly get rid of your stuff](/scene-nine)


## DEATH FOUR
You try to keep the walls from closing in by prying them open, but they're way to strong. You're slowly squished until you pop like a grape.

## SCENE NINE
You gather up the clutter around your living room and look for a place to chuck it... The window! But as you go to throw your junk out, the window snaps shut and locks itself. The window has always been so damn stubborn! This is it, you're going to drown in your own junk!

- [Quick! Look for the Source Key!](/death-five)
- [Try to unlock the window](/death-six)
- [ITEM: DRAIN PIPE](/scene-ten)


## DEATH FIVE
You frantically look for the Source Key in a race against the clock, but there's too much stuff to sift through and it looks like all your junk is now multiplying. You're squished to death under the weight of your own apartment objects.

## DEATH SIX
You try to unlock the window, but the window is as stubborn as you remember. The window just laughs at you as you're drowned to death under the weight of your own clutter.

## SCENE TEN
GREAT THINKING! You smash the window open with the drain pipe! Immediately you start throwing things out onto the street until you finally find the Source Key! 

## PRIZE TWO

You gained the source key!
