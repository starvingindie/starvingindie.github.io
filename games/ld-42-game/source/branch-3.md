## SCENE THREE ALTERNATE
This apartment is so cluttered, who knows where the key could be. Maybe it's better to just craft the Source Key instead of go looking for it. As you head to the kitchen to grab the ingredients, it goes up in a blaze of fire. An angry Kitchen Devil (a coffee maker) appears.

- [Defeat the Kitchen Devil](/chapter-three-four)

## CHAPTER THREE-FOUR
You go to unplug the annoying Kitchen Devil, but as you get closer the fire gets hotter and hotter! You have to keep your distance or else you'll sure melt into a pile of molten, human ash. If only you could put out the fire...

## SCENE TWENTY-SIX
You go to the bathroom in search of water, but when you turn on the faucet a bunch of Demon Slugs slither out. GROSS! They're poisonous and are making their way towards you. They have to have a weakness of some kind...

- [Probably fire](/scene-twenty-seven)
- [Pick them up and flush them in the toilet](/death-twenty)


## DEATH TWENTY

What did I just say!? They're poisonous! You pick them up with your bare hands and immediately break out in hives and boils. There's no way you can go on a date looking like this!

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty-six)

## SCENE TWENTY-SEVEN
You race back to the living room and grab a shirt. You wrap it around your remote and light it on fire using the flames from the kitchen. When you turn around the whole apartment is infested with these poisenous slugs. Ugh! Leaving the faucet running is a bad habit.

- [Burn this baby down!](/scene-twenty-eight)
- [Try to run through them](/death-twenty-one)

## DEATH TWENTY-ONE
Yeah, that's not gonna work. You see, like I said, these are poisonous slugs. They quickly swarm you and cover your body. You immediately break out in hives and boils. There's no way you can go on a date looking like this!

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty-six)

## SCENE TWENTY EIGHT
You light your whole apartment on fire. Not exactly solving the problem, but it's some progress. With the slugs burning to death, you go to the bathroom and rip out the toilet, causing a massive flood in your apartment.

- [>](/prize-six)

## PRIZE SIX
You found an empty bottle in your medicine cabinet, a Drain Pipe and a Soap Bar! Yay!

- [>](/scene-twenty-nine)

## SCENE TWENTY-NINE
You head back to the kitchen, but the you discover the flood was not enough to kill the Kitchen Devil Coffee Maker! He laughs at you, as he continues to burn down your kitchen. Jerk! If there was only a way to throw water on him!

- [ITEM: TOILET WATER](/scene-thirty)

## SCENE THIRTY

GREAT THINKING! You fill your empty bottle with toilet water and throw it at the Coffee Maker. The gross toilet water immediately nullifies him! Now you just need to remember how to mold a Source Key...

- [ITEM: SOAP BAR](/scene-thirty-one)
- [ITEM: TOILET WATER](/death-twenty-two)
- [ITEM: DRAIN PIPE](/death-twenty-three)

## DEATH TWENTY-TWO
You drink the toilet water. I don't know why, but you do. And then immediately you feel sick to your stomach. There's no way you're going to make your date now.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty-six)


## DEATH TWENTY-THREE
You waist away hours trying to figure out how to turn a drain pipe into a key. Yeah, that didn't work and you missed your date.

- [RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT](/scene-twenty-six)

## SCENE THIRTY ONE
GREAT THINKING! You use the soap bar and some utensils from the kitchen to craft another Source Key!
